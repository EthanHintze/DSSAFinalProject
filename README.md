Time Complexity for CheckForTreasure() (line 210)
Because queue's have a bestcase of O(1) the worst possible time complexity 
is O(n) if you had to access inventory.First()  multple times

Time Complexity for TraverseDungeon()
the time complexity of this operation is O(n+m) where n is number of 
rooms and m is the number of edges

Time Complexity for FindClosest
The time complexity of this operation is O(log n) where n is the number of nodes
